Do you ever think to yourself: "man, if only I had access to a website with a bunch of buttons that each produce a sound that shares seemingly no relation to the sounds produced by other buttons on the website, then I could be a world-class musician?"

If you answered yes to this question, then this website is for you. Check out the GitHub pages page for this repo, where you transform your keyboard and/or keys into a musical instrument: https://604adrian.github.io/computer-music/
