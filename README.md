# Computer Music
Do you ever think to yourself: "man, if only I had access to a website with a bunch of buttons that each produce a sound that shares seemingly no relation to the sounds produced by other buttons on the website, then I could be a world-class musician"?

If you answered yes to this question, then this website is for you. Check out the GitHub pages page for this repo, where you transform your keyboard and/or keys into a musical instrument: https://604adrian.github.io/computer-music/

## How do I use this website?
Good question. To use this website, simply click on the buttons displayed on the screen, or press the key on your keyboard that is associated with that button. This should play a sound that matches the image on the button (e.g. if you click the rooster button it will play the sound of a rooster).
